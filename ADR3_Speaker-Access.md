# ADR3: Speaker Access

**Status**

Accepted

**Context**

Playing a tic-tac-toe style game is fun, but building it as a mobile game provides an opportunity to use mobile hardware such as the speakers to make the game more exciting and engaging for users. Incorporating sounds while the game is on going and triggering sound effects when there are major actions or events that happen in the game, offers added app interactivity.

**Decision**

Interactivity is essential in a game application. It is agreed upon to incorporate sounds/sound effects which will play through the device speakers during gameplay. It will elevate both the user and gameplay experience.

**Consequences**

By using the speakers to play sounds/sound effects in the game, capturing the userâ€™s attention towards the game will be easier. At the same time, some users may be sensitive to the sounds and might prefer a quiet game, so options to disable this feature will be included. Additionally, incorporating sound will negatively affect the mobile device's battery.
