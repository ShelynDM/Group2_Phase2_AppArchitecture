# ADR3: Speaker Access

**Status**
Accepted

**Context**
Playing a tic-tac-toe game type is fun, but building it as mobile gave gives opportunity in using the mobile hardware such as the speakers to make the game more exciting and engaging to the users. Incorporating sounds while the game is on going and trigger some sound effects when there are major actions or events that happens in the game gives added interactivity to the app.

**Decision**
With the added interactivity that is essential in a game application it is decided to incorporate sounds and sounds effects through the device speakers during the gameplay. It will also elevate both user and the gameplay experience.

**Consequences**
By using the speakers to play sounds and sound effects to the game, it is easier to capture our userâ€™s attention towards the game. At the same time, some user may be sensitive to the sound and might prefer a quiet game so we will be adding options to the user to disable this feature. Additionally, incorporating sound if able will negatively affect the mobile's battery.
