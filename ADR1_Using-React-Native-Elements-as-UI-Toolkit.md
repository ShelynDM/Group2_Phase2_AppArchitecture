# ADR1: Using React Native Elements as UI Toolkit

**Status**
Accepted

**Context**
React Native Elements is a useful toolkit that provides a variety of customizable UI components to make developing mobile apps using React Native easier. It offers a wide range of customization choices, guarantees a consistent user interface across platforms, and helps to speed up the development process using pre-designed components.

**Decision**
With pre-styled components React Native Elements can offer ready-made components that are useful for games such as tic-tac-toe so it is decided that the UI toolkit will be React Native Elements.

**Consequences**
Since React Native Elements is a general-purpose UI toolkit, it might lack specific components that is needed for a game application.
