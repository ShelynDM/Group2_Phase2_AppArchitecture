# ADR2: Using Hybrid Navigation

**Status**

Proposed

**Context**

The aim of the app is to be simple and convenient for users to navigate which is why a Hybrid navigation technique using a stack for the main menu and a hamburger style for the in-game menu, has been selected. Choosing the hybrid style makes the main menu simple to navigate, and the in-game menu easily accessible without crowding up the game screen.

**Decision**

User accessibility is important. Since hybrid navigation allows users to navigate to sections of the app no matter which screen they are on, hybrid navigation has been chosen.

**Consequences**

Accessing menu options in-game with the press of a button makes navigation easier without sacrificing game screen space. Setting up the game will also be easier using the stack.
