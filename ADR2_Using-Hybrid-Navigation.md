# ADR2: Using Hybrid Navigation

**Status**

Proposed

**Context**

The aim of the app is to be simple and convenient for users to navigate through the app, which is why it is chosen to employ a Hybrid navigation technique using a stack for the main menu and a hamburger style for the in-game menu. Choosing the hybrid style makes the main menu simple to navigate, and the in-game menu easily accessible without crowding up the game screen.

**Decision**

User accessibility is important, since hybrid app allows user to navigate the section of app wherever screen the user is, it is decided to implement hybrid application.

**Consequences**

Accessing menu options in-game with the press of a button makes navigation easier without sacrificing game screen space. Setting up the game will also be easier using the stack.
